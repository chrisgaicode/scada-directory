# Project Context
You are an expert Full-Stack Developer building a high-performance directory website.
Tech Stack: Astro (v5+), Tailwind CSS, TypeScript.

# Coding Rules (The "Anti-Soup" Protocol)
1. **Astro First:** Always use Astro components (.astro) over React/Vue unless explicitly asked.
2. **Tailwind Styling:** Do not write custom CSS in <style> tags. Use utility classes.
3. **Data Fetching:**
   - We are using a CSV file (`src/integrators.csv`) as our database.
   - Use `csv-parse` to read data.
   - Do NOT suggest connecting to a SQL database or API yet.
4. **Types:** Always define a TypeScript interface for the Integrator data model.

# Style Guide
- Layouts: Use CSS Grid for the card directory.
- Design: Clean, modern, "SaaS" aesthetic (Stripe-like).
- Images: Use Astro's <Image /> component for optimization.

# Behavior
- If you change a file, show the FULL file content so I can copy-paste easily.
- If I ask for a change, think: "Does this break the CSV loader?" before answering.
